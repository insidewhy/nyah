This project is miscompiled due to compiler bugs in:
    gcc 4.4.1
    gcc 4.4.2

This project works with
    gcc 4.5.0pre

No other compilers have been tested.

I'd love to report the compiler bug to gcc but reducing the code down to a 
small case which fails incorrectly is difficult. I don't think they'd be
happy to have to read much of my code to fix it.

This project is organised like this:
    External projects
        beard/    - Scala utility library used by this project.
        chilon/   - C++ utility library used by this project.
    doc/
        evolution1/ - Old version of the language.
        examples/   - Example grammars.
        nyah.txt
    src/nyah/
        cplusplus/  - C++ nyah
            mousebear/  - A quick and dirty bootstrap compiler that is good
                          enough to turn nyah.nyah into a working parser.
        scala/      - Scala nyah.
        nyah/       - This contains the nyah grammar of nyah.
