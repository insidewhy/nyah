This project needs gcc 4.4 at least to compile.

In addition I've found gcc 4.4.1 compiles some of the code to do with testing
char_ in lexeme incorrectly. Tests which should succeed are failed due to
bad asm. Not sure if gcc 4.4.0 works, about to try gcc 4.4.2.

This project is organised like this:

        cplusplus/  - C++ nyah
            mousebear/  - A quick and dirty bootstrap compiler that is good
                          enough to turn nyah.nyah into a working parser.
        scala/      - Scala nyah.
        nyah/       - This contains the nyah grammar of nyah.
