Single Character Matches:
  \n newline
  \s whitespace
  \t tab
  \' parser for single quote
  \" parser to match double quote
  .  any character.
  [abc]    Match any of the individual characters a, b or c.
  [!abc]   Match any character except a, b or c.
    
Order Precedence
    !a     Returns false if a matches, and true if a fails,
           If a is a single character match then advance the parser
           by one character (unless & is used before !), otherwise the 
           position is left as it was before the !a rule was started.

    &a     Match a but leave the parser position where it was before the &a
           rule was started on success.

    a*     Match a zero or more times.
    a+     Match a one or more times.

    a?     Match a zero or once.

    a  b     Match a followed by b.

    a ^ b    Match a followed by b with no whitespace between.

    a - b    Match a but not b.

    a | b    Try to match a, then try to match b if that fails.

    a ~ b    Match a followed by b.

Shortcuts
    - Transitivity of -:
        For a - b, b is transitive over any |s in a e.g.
        (a | b) - c  --> (a - c | b - c)

        a* - b --> (a - b)*

        Combining these
        (a | b)* - c  --> (a - c | b - c)*
